Pygame (for the graphical interface):

```Bash
pip install pygame
```
pyserial (for communicating with the ESP32 over USB):
```Bash
pip install pyserial
```
pyautogui (for controlling the keyboard to type text and press hotkeys):
```Bash
pip install pyautogui
```
The other libraries used in the script (like tkinter, json, os, threading, etc.) are part of Python's standard library, so you don't need to install them.
